### How we built it
- started with simple stuff, such as detection of occupancy
- trying to get an end-to-end breakthrough as fast as possible
- iteratively extend / enhance what we've got

### Learnings
- great format, aka small junks during multiple days
- forming teams was challenging
- serial communication is a pain
- 1st time hackathon, it's fun!

### Next steps / missing items
- [ ] geolocalization
- [ ] make data to opendata
- [ ] test it in real
- [ ] "sleep" mode of all devices
- [ ] meaningful representation
