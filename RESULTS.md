### Achievements
- implemented a library to communicate with the lorawan module
- implemented a poc sending duration of occupancy along with a summary of environmental data
- very basic "visualisation"
- met new people!

### How we built it
- started with simple stuff, such as detection of occupancy
- trying to get an end-to-end breakthrough as fast as possible
- iteratively extend / enhance what we've got

### Learnings
- great format, aka small junks during multiple days
- forming teams was challenging
- serial communication is a pain
- datasheets are key!
- 1st time hackathon, it's fun!
- arduino ide seems to suck big time. Luckily I used platformio :-)

### Next steps / missing items
- [ ] geolocalization
- [ ] low power mode / power mgmt
- [ ] waterproof box
- [ ] sync with representatives
- [ ] make data to opendata
- [ ] test it in real
- [ ] meaningful representation
